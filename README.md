# NOAA Weather Data Pipeline

A complete, end-to-end data engineering pipeline built to demonstrate proficiency in ingestion, transformation, and loading of real-world weather data using Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, and industry-standard tools.

## Project Overview

This pipeline ingests historical weather data from the [NOAA GSOD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-summary-of-the-day/) dataset, processes it, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database for analysis and dashboarding.

**Key Goals:**

- Showcase strong Python and SQL skills
- Demonstrate working knowledge of ETL architecture
- Practice using Docker, version control, and APIs
- Build a portfolio-ready data engineering project
